As the rest of my projects, I release Construct under public domain. That said, you may do whatever you want with this library, and I will not be held liable to anything you may consider damaging. However, if you find this library useful, I'd appreciate it if you tell me / spread the word / link to this site. Just to make me feel good when I run my name through google :)
